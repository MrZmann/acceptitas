          <h3>Hi, I'm Emmet!</h3>
          <p>
            â€¦ is what Emmet would say with a big smile if this was written in
            the first person. Emmet is an undergraduate at Harvard who has a
            passion for helping others succeed, experience teaching, and
            first-hand experience in the college admissions process. He also has experience teaching, consulting, and mentoring students applying to college.<br></br>With an eye
            for engaging story-telling, Emmet studies history, writes about
            politics, and frequently performs standup comedy at Harvard. He
            loves meeting new people, learning what motivates them, and helping
            them maximize their strengths.

          <h3>Emmet's Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            Emmet struggled with learning differences in school and was
            cautioned that since writing and language learning would be too
            difficult, college might not be for him. <br></br>Ironically, he developed a
            love for these subjects and has since worked as a middle-school
            writing teacher, Editor-In-Chief of his high school newspaper, and
            currently, a comedy writer. He also now speaks Spanish, French, and
            Russian, despite his early struggle with reading and writing. <br></br>When
            it came time to apply to college, at first Emmet spent lots of time
            on cliche essays, fruitless premises, and focused on what he thought
            his application should look like. Only when he reflected on his life
            in broad terms did he realize that he had a compelling narrative to
            tell. <br></br>Through various techniques developed along the way, Emmet was
            able to bring his personal narrative to life throughout his college
            application. He created Acceptitas to make college admissions more
            personal, more engaging, and more affordable for students like
            himself.
