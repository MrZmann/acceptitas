          <h1>Hi I'm Emmet!</h1>
          <p>… is what Emmet would say with a big smile if this was written in the first person. Emmet is an undergraduate at Harvard who has a passion for helping others succeed, experience teaching, and first-hand experience in the college admissions process. With an eye for engaging story-telling, Emmet studies History, writes about politics, and frequently performs standup comedy at Harvard. He loves meeting new people, learning what motivates them, and helping them maximize their strengths.

          <h1>Emmet's Story</h1>
          <p>Emmet struggled with learning differences in school and was cautioned that because writing and language learning would be too difficult, college might not be for him. Ironically, he developed a love for these subjects and has worked as a middle-school writing teacher, Editor-In-Chief of his highschool newspaper, and a current, a comedy writer. He also now speaks Spanish, French, and Russian, despite his early struggle with his native language. When it came time to apply to college, at first Emmet spent lots of time on cliche essays, fruitless premises, and focused on what he thought his application should look like. Only when he reflected on his life in broad terms did he realize that he had a compelling narrative to tell. Through various techniques developed along the way, Emmet was able to bring his personal narrative to life throughout his college application.</p>
