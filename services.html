          <h1>“Find Your Narrative” Strategy Consultations</h1>
          <p>The difference between those of a similar caliber who get in versus being passed over depends on your personal narrative--the unique story of you that makes the admissions officer want to take a chance on you. We use our first-hand experience to help you identify and craft your most compelling narrative through our strategy consultations. We will get to know you, examine your life experiences, interests, and aspirations to craft your unique application narrative. After our meeting, you will receive an assessment of your current narrative, its strengths, areas for growth, and an action plan for refining your story across your application materials.

          <h1>Application Narrative Assessment</h1>
          <p>No matter where you are in the application process, Acceptitas is here to empower you to maximize your potential. Unlike many admissions counselors and services, we recognize that your essays are not read in an isolated bubble, but rather part of your larger application packet narrative. As such, we review your current application packet materials, provide constructive feedback, and help you identify and amplify your strongest narratives. Part of this process is a “mock admissions read” which we use as a diagnostic test of your narrative’s strength. With Acceptitas, you will have a personal coach, you will give you timely, candid, and actionable feedback at any stage in the process. We provide everything from routine assessment and feedback to one-time narrative-strengthening meetings and reports.

          <h1>Mock Interviews</h1>
          <p>The interview is another critical part of a student’s overall application, which has the potential to bring a narrative to life or drag it down. Learn how to lean into your strengths and naturally support your overall application narrative through our mock interviews, conducted by someone who has successful first-hand experience. Each mock interview comes with an after-action report that identifies actionable areas of growth for the big day.</p>
